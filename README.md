Observations:

1) A vast majority of the surface area of the world is water, this means that a large majority of the cities are coastal cities located closest to the random lat and lng values. Coastal cities are not very representative of all cities. The humidity chart proves this as most of the data points are from high humidity areas.
2) After filtering the data I found that a lot more data is available from cities in the norther hemisphere than the south. Typically the norther hemisphere is more developed and has more weather than the south. This shows that the temperature does increase progressing from the north pole to the equator, however the data from the south pole to the equator doesn’t show that trend as well.
3) Wind speed records show a large amount of high wind speeds around 50 degrees longitude.
